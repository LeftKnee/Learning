# Sqlite database for WebAssembly

This is a simple standalone app demonstrating the use of SQLite in an Uno application, including WebAssembly. It uses Erik Sink's [SQLitePCLRaw](https://github.com/ericsink/SQLitePCL.raw), and Frank Krueger's [sqlite-net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net) libraries.

The WebAssembly application uses the [Uno.SQLitePCLRaw.Wasm](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.SQLitePCLRaw.Wasm) package to provide an in-browser, client-side SQLite database.
